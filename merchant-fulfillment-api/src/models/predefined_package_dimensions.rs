/// PredefinedPackageDimensions : An enumeration of predefined parcel tokens. If you specify a PredefinedPackageDimensions token, you are not obligated to use a branded package from a carrier. For example, if you specify the FedEx_Box_10kg token, you do not have to use that particular package from FedEx. You are only obligated to use a box that matches the dimensions specified by the token.  Note: Please note that carriers can have restrictions on the type of package allowed for certain ship methods. Check the carrier website for all details. Example: Flat rate pricing is available when materials are sent by USPS in a USPS-produced Flat Rate Envelope or Box.
